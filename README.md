# Monopoly-App
A web app made in Python Flask, that allows users to maintain monopoly money. This is an alternative to physical money.

## How to Run
1. In the code for "app.py" change the host ip to your device's IP address
2. Navigate to the containing folder and run the "app.py" through command line.
3. Have fun

## TODO
- Add alerts when an user makes an error
- Add new rulesets (The current ruleset is custom to what me and my friends use)
